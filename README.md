You can search stocks and add to or remove from a portfolio. Portfolio items are clickable and lead to a details page.

## Todo before start

After cloning and running npm install you need to create a .env file with and define a variable named REACT_APP_ALPHA_API_KEY.
You can get a free api key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key)

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts JSON-Server and the app.

Delay on JSON-Server response time can be set with the --delay flag:

`"start-api": "json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json --delay 1000",`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
